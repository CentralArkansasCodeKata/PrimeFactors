Prime Factors
=============

Using test driven development (TDD) write a prime factor generator method and at least 7 unit tests to go along with it.  You are more than welcome to write more unit tests if you prefer.

###Task
Write a method that will take an integer parameter and return a collection of integers.  The method should return the prime factors for the input parameter. You can write the answer in whatever language you prefer so the collection of integers can be whatever is used to represent a list of integers in the language you choose to use to solve the problem.  For bonus points see how few lines of code you can write it in and still have a valid solution without using any framework or built-in methods besides basic math methods (i.e. add, subtract, multiply, divide, and modulus).

###Input
Create at least 7 unit tests with these test input parameters:
* 1
* 2
* 3
* 4
* 6
* 8
* 9

###Output
The answers to the above inputs are listed below in the same order:
* emtpy list
* 2
* 3
* 2, 2
* 2, 3
* 2, 2, 2
* 3, 3
